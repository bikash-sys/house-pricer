## 🧠 How It Works

- Pricing is calculated based on a **base rate per square foot** depending on the **location**.
- For **houses**, price adjusts based on:
  - **Condition** of the property (newer = higher)
  - **Additional features** like parking, pool, garden, etc.
- Intelligent backend logic estimates a realistic price using a multiplier system.
